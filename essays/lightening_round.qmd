If Pablo Nguyen doesn\'t earn an A, then nobody should, because I think every time
we worked together he showed a massive eagerness to try and learn the material
as well as being collaborative. I think there was a lot of times throughout the quarter
where I was lost in how to accomplish a certain task. I think Pablo was able to help me in
this regard by either guiding me in the right direction, or if we were both collectively stuck
figuring out potential solutions.
			

I think the most diï¬€icult part of the class was surprisingly completing the practice
activities. I think this is because I would consider myself a learner by example and it was hard
to translate the lectures and preview activities we learned to actually applying it to different
sets of data. I do believe however that because of this struggle it somewhat helped me learn
the material a bit better and by the time the lab was released I felt prepared to do
it.
					

The easiest part of the class was getting myself motivated to do the work. I think
there was only a few times in which I was unmotivated to actually work in this class. I often found
surprisingly enjoying the struggle of not figuring out how to do a certain problem and exploring
solutions (I can not say the same for other courses).
					

A piece of advice I would give would be to realize that the beginning weeks when first
learning R is the hardest. I think around Lab 4, I had a decent amount of stress with the
amount of work. However, if you stick with it and ask questions when your are uncertain about things, I found that it became much easier to grasp new topics and I am now confident in my R capabilities.
